# üëã Hi there! üëã

My name is Marco, I am from Poland and I'm an aspiring software engineer!

## ‚ú® Current project ‚ú®

I‚Äôm currently working on my engineering thesis! (which I sadly have to keep in a private repository until the thesis defense üòû)

It's a mobile application based on **Flutter**, which allows you to browse and search for recipes, add them to your favorites, manage your fridge content, and allows for searching the database for recipes including chosen ingredients. 
  
The recipes on the application are on two different locations: my own **Firebase NoSQL database**, and pulled from the **Spoonacular API**. They are pulled from both locations, and unified in one DTO in a **Spring Boot API** to allow for easy display on the application.

I'm also planning to do a personal project using Kotlin and Spring in the near future.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Current focus ‚ùÑÔ∏è
My main focus is to finish my thesis, and in the meantime find an opportunity to help me grow my development skills in an actual project.
In my free time I also try to hone my skills. One of the skills I'm looking forward to improving is learning about testing (JUnit, TDD, etc.)
